# visited-countries-map

This is a static website template for creating a map showing countries a user has visited. It includes:

- A GeoJSON file with country boundaries,
- JavaScript code for map generation using Leaflet,
- A CSV file listing visited countries.

This template utilizes [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com/) for map tiles. To ensure Stadia Maps functionality, users need to register their domain with Stadia Maps, which is free as of now.

To add or remove countries visited, modify the CSV file `visited-countries.csv`.
